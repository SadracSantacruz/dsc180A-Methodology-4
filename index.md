**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic on my domain I think has been the use of AI, and the platforms like n8n. Agentic worflows has been an amazing topic.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to continue working with AI worflows in a great manner. Maybe running studies with n8n and somehow collecting data from our users.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I think that things are great so far, however, I think that at the very beggining of the quarter it was a little confusing on what we were doing. Now things make a lot more sence. But it would have been great to have a little more guidance at the beggining.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
My capstone project team and I are working on a gamified aplication for users with little no knoledge of ML they can learn with our Web App. If there's a way for us to somehow collect audiou from our users for better undertanding of the topics, I think that thaat would be great. That would tottally add a new layer of complexity but is something that I would love to do.
